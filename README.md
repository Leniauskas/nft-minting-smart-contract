# nft-minting-smart-contract
Prime example of ERC721A NFT minting smart contract.  

Key feautures:  
• presale (or private sale) and public mint stages;  
• adjustable token URI, price and total supply;  
• use of merkle trees for whitelisted addresses distribution;  
• unique timed token burning mechanism.
